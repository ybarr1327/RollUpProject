FOR THE GRADING:
In order to access the pages that require admin privileges, you should use the 
professor admin Rollup account. For this account we created a gmail account and an
account for our website. You need both because our website sends emails to the
users accounts if you use that one to test everything. You can also create an
account using the register button on our website, but you would have to provide
an email and password to create that account.

The urls that only the admin can access are the following
BASE_URL/admin
BASE_URL/notify
To visit them you have to type them in the address bar
All other urls are accessible throught the UI

The Rollup Email account is basically the account where the staff would 
theoretically recieve the emails from the contact page or the covid reports.
If you test either of those features you need that email to see the received 
emails..

How To Use The website:
When Visiting the site, you have access to the following without logging in
Home
About
Class Information
Contact

To Login Click on the Login Button in the nav bar at the top and there you can 
either login, create a new account or register for a new account.

You can also go to the login for admins by visiting the /admin page

On the admin page you can click on the classes or participants pages so view the database contents and manage them

On the admin page, if you click on classes you can here see all the classes created and click on an individual one to edit or delete it or if you press on the button in the top right you can instantiate a new class, all fields must be filled for it to work properly. The same behavior is for the participants too. 

When logged in as a regular user you arrive at the account dashboard where you can see all the classes available, view the faq, view the classes you signed up for, and the covid reporting page.

For the class sign up you basically check the boxes of the classes you want and then press the sign up button

For the my classes page it is similar where you check the boxes and you click 
Unregister.

Also as a logged in user you can change your password using the navbar as well.
